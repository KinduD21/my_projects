Good morning, Night City
A day in the life
I was on my own, catching a ride
With the lady, her hair hangs down past her thighs
Blue rimmed pistol, she satisfies
Leather jacket, zipped up tight
Man down, big ones coming, look for lost and found
Iron gleams bright in Night City
Where your appetite wears you out till sunrise

She pulls my trigger
Got me up alright
It's a danger pretty here in Night City
Here in Night City, got me up alright, here in Night City

The way you chase and tease me
Get me up so high
We're on the rooftop and you don't compromise
Too many hollow empty bodies lying round my street don't testify
